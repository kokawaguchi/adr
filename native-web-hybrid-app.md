# Architecture Decision Record: Native, Web or Hybrid App

## Context

The team is tasked with creating a new app for a client that allows users to order food from local restaurants for delivery or pickup. The team needs to decide on the approach for developing the food ordering app: whether to develop it as a native mobile, web, or hyrbid application.

## Decision

We have decided to develop the food ordering app as a native mobile application

## Rationale

- **Performance and User Experience** : Native apps provide a smoother and quicker user experience than web or hybrid apps because they can use the special features of a device's hardware and software. This is especially important for a food ordering app where speed and ease of use are vital.
- **Access to Device Features** : It allows us to leverage device features such as GPS for location tracking, push notifications for order updates, and camera for scanning QR codes or capturing images, enhancing the functionality and user experience of the app.
- **Security** : Native apps can offer enhanced security measures, such as secure storage of payment information and user data, which is critical for handling sensitive information in a food ordering application.

## Consequences

- Developing a native app may require more time and resources compared to a web or hybrid app
- The team will need to develop separate versions of the app for different platforms (iOS and Android), which can increase development complexity.
- Ongoing maintenance and updates will be required for each platform the app is deployed on.

## Conclusion

The decision to develop a native app aligns with the client's requirements for a high-performance, feature-rich, and secure food ordering application. While it may involve additional development effort, the benefits of native development outweigh any downsides in this scenario.
